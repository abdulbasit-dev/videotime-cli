# 📼 VideoTime CLI

**VideoTime CLI** is a simple command-line tool that calculates the total duration of all video files in a given folder. It supports
multiple video formats and does not require FFmpeg to be installed system-wide.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically detects and calculates the duration of all videos in a folder
- Supports common video formats: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.flv`, `.wmv`
- No system dependencies—bundled with **FFmpeg and FFprobe**
- User-friendly console output with **Chalk** for styling

## 📌 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/videotime-cli.git

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Make the CLI globally accessible:
   ```sh

   ```

## 🔥 Usage

Run the CLI tool with the path to a folder containing videos:

```sh
videotime "/path/to/video/folder"
```
