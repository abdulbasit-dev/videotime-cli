# 📼 VideoTime CLI

**VideoTime CLI** is a simple command-line tool that calculates the total duration of all video files in a given folder. It supports
multiple video formats and comes bundled with **FFmpeg** and **FFprobe**, so you don't need to install them system-wide.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 **Automatic Video Detection**: Detects and calculates the duration of all videos in a folder.
- 📂 **Supports Common Formats**: Works with `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.flv`, and `.wmv`.
- ⚙️ **No System Dependencies**: Bundled with **FFmpeg** and **FFprobe** for hassle-free usage.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Output**: Uses **Chalk** for styled and readable console output.

## 📌 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abdulbasit-dev/videotime-cli.git
   cd videotime-cli
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Option 1: Run Directly (No Global Installation)

You can run the CLI tool directly using `npm run` without installing it globally. Add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "videotime": "node index.js"
}
```

Then, run the tool with:

```sh
npm run videotime -- "/path/to/video/folder"
```

### Option 2: Install Globally (Optional)

If you prefer to make the CLI globally accessible, run:

```sh
npm link
```

After linking, you can use the `videotime` command from anywhere:

```sh
videotime "/path/to/video/folder"
```

## 🔥 Usage

Run the CLI tool with the path to a folder containing videos:

```sh
videotime "/path/to/video/folder"
```

If you’re already inside the folder containing the videos, you can simply run:

```sh
videotime .
```

Or, if using the `npm run` method:

```sh
npm run videotime -- "/path/to/video/folder"
```

### 📌 Example Output

```
📂 Found 3 video(s). Calculating total duration...

✔ Processed: "video1.mp4" → 2:30 minutes
✔ Processed: "video2.mp4" → 5:45 minutes
✔ Processed: "video3.mp4" → 1:15 minutes

⏳ Total Duration: 0h 9m 30s
```
